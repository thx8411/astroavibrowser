Known Bugs :

 - Browsing frames back is very slow because we have to scan all the stream
   to get the real frame number (no index used)
 - Y8 and raw RGB outputs doesn't work (including color separation)
 - file replace not well managed (.avi postfix added and libavfile FatalError)
 - no proper display with some p-b frames codecs
 - main don't resize well when opening a video smaller than the last one
